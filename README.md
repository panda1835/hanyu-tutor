## üéØ How It Works

### Learning Algorithm
HanyuTutor uses a **spaced repetition system** based on the Fibonacci sequence to optimize memory retention:

1. **New Words**: Introduced immediately
2. **Review Intervals**: 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29 days
3. **Adaptive Difficulty**: Incorrect answers reset the interval
4. **Mastery**: Words graduate after multiple successful reviews

### Daily Batches
- **Consistent Sets**: Same words appear each day using date-based seeding
- **Re-study Option**: Continue learning even after daily goals are met
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear visualization of daily and overall progress

### Data Management
- **Local Storage**: Progress saved in browser for offline use
- **Vocabulary Database**: HSK-level Chinese words with pinyin and definitions
- **Smart Filtering**: Study specific levels or categories as needed

## üé® Design Philosophy

Inspired by Anki and Duolingo, HanyuTutor prioritizes:
- **Learnability**: Intuitive, distraction-free interface
- **Efficiency**: Fast, focused learning sessions
- **Accessibility**: High contrast, readable typography
- **Consistency**: Predictable interactions and visual design

### Typography
- **Latin Text**: Inter font for optimal readability
- **Chinese Characters**: Noto Sans CJK SC for character clarity
- **Hierarchy**: Clear information architecture with appropriate sizing

### Color System
- **Trust & Focus**: Deep blue primary color
- **Success States**: Green for correct answers
- **Warning States**: Orange for items needing review
- **Dark Mode**: Carefully calibrated for comfortable night studying

## üìä Learning Statistics

Track your progress with comprehensive metrics:
- **Words Learned Today**: Daily learning count
